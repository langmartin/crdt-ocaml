** Development

Trying to use the dune defaults to install externals and everything.
I've got a couple of setup things in the Makefile for now.

- [ ] Reinstall everything from scratch to make sure this setup works

#+begin_src sh
  make deps
  make
#+end_src

For emacs, I think ~utop~ is the most straightforward way to go.
Here's what I have now:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun rc-ocaml-mode ()
    (package-require 'tuareg)
    (package-require 'ocp-indent)
    (package-require 'utop)
    (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'cleanup-untabify-save)
    (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode t)
    (setq utop-command "opam exec -- dune utop . -- -emacs")
    (autoload 'utop-minor-mode "utop" "Minor mode for utop" t)
    (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'utop-minor-mode)
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/Users/lang/.opam/default/share/emacs/site-lisp"))
#+end_src
