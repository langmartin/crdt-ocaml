* Development

I haven't found out how to load the project with merlin or tuareg or
whatever yet, so this is just some code to evaluate in the repl to
load the project up.

#+begin_src ocaml
  #use "topfind";;
  #directory "/Users/lang/.opam/default/lib/stublibs";;
  #use_output "dune ocaml top";;
  open Ocaml_crdt;;
#+end_src
