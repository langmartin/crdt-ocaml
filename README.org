* Development

I haven't found out how to load the project with merlin or tuareg or
whatever yet, so this is just some code to evaluate in the repl to
load the project up.

#+begin_src ocaml
   #load "unix.cma";;
   #mod_use "hlc.ml";; #mod_use "hulc.ml";; #mod_use "anti_entropy.ml";; #mod_use "world.ml";;
#+end_src
